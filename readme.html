# Home Automation Using Arduino

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a home automation system using an Arduino board with Bluetooth capability, allowing remote control via any Android OS smartphone. With advancing technology, modern houses are transitioning to centralized control systems, providing convenience and accessibility. This system replaces conventional wall switches with a smartphone application, enabling users to remotely operate home appliances. It particularly benefits individuals with mobility challenges, such as the elderly or physically impaired.

## Features
- Remote control of home appliances via Bluetooth-enabled Android smartphone.
- Intuitive GUI application for smartphone control.
- Optoisolators and thyristors (triacs) ensure safe operation of AC loads.
- Seamless integration with Arduino board for reliable performance.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano)
- Bluetooth Module (e.g., HC-05, HC-06)
- Optoisolators
- Thyristors or Triacs
- AC Loads (e.g., lights, fans)

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE (for Arduino code development)
- Android Studio or MIT App Inventor (for Android app development)

## Getting Started
1. Connect the hardware components as per the provided circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino code (`arduino_code.ino`) to the Arduino board.
3. Pair the Bluetooth module with the Android smartphone.
4. Install and run the Android app (`home_automation_app.apk`) on the smartphone.
5. Use the app to send ON/OFF commands and remotely control the connected loads.

## Safety Considerations
- Ensure proper insulation and wiring to prevent electrical hazards.
- Use components with appropriate ratings to handle load requirements safely.
- Implement safety features in the software to prevent unintended activations.

## Further Improvements
- Expand the system with additional features such as scheduling or sensor integration.
- Enhance the user interface and functionality of the Android app.
- Experiment with voice control integration for hands-free operation.
